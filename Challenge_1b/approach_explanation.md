# Methodology: Font-Based Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Core Approach

Our solution employs a sophisticated font-based analysis system that leverages typographical characteristics to identify document structure and extract persona-relevant content. This approach ensures generic applicability across diverse domains while maintaining high accuracy.

## Font-Based Document Structure Analysis

The system uses PyMuPDF to extract detailed font information (size, boldness, positioning) from each document. By analyzing font size distributions, we identify the most common font as body text and detect headings based on size ratios, boldness, and structural patterns. This method works universally across research papers, business reports, and educational materials without domain-specific hardcoding.

## Multi-Stage Section Extraction

**Stage 1: Text Block Grouping** - Individual text spans are intelligently grouped into complete lines, preventing fragmentation of section titles and ensuring coherent heading reconstruction.

**Stage 2: Heading Detection** - Our algorithm combines multiple signals: font size ratios (â‰¥1.2x body text), boldness indicators, structural patterns (numbered sections, title case), and contextual validation (checking if headings are followed by content).

**Stage 3: Content Boundary Detection** - For each identified heading, we extract the associated content by analyzing positional relationships and natural section breaks, ensuring comprehensive coverage without overlap.

## Persona-Driven Relevance Scoring

The system dynamically extracts keywords from persona descriptions and job-to-be-done specifications, then applies semantic expansion based on context. A multi-factor relevance scoring system evaluates:

- **Title Keyword Matching** (highest weight) - Direct matches in section titles
- **Content Density Analysis** - Keyword frequency within section content  
- **Semantic Indicators** - Action words, process terms, and domain-specific terminology
- **Quality Assessment** - Content length, instructional value, and information density

## Intelligent Selection and Ranking

Our selection algorithm ensures diversity across documents while prioritizing relevance. It prevents near-duplicate sections, maintains document representation balance, and applies adaptive thresholds based on content quality. The final ranking considers both relevance scores and document coverage to provide comprehensive results.

## Generic Design Philosophy

The solution avoids hardcoded domain knowledge, instead using adaptive keyword expansion and universal structural patterns. This enables seamless operation across academic research, business analysis, and educational content scenarios. The font-based approach captures document intent regardless of subject matter, while the persona-driven scoring adapts to specific user needs.

## Performance Optimizations

Memory-efficient processing handles multiple documents within the 60-second constraint. The system clears analysis data between documents and uses optimized text extraction strategies for various PDF encodings, ensuring reliable performance across document types and sizes.
